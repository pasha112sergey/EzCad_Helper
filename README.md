# EzCad_Helper
The EzCad Helper is a Python tkinter and OpenCV project software project that aims to increase productivity of laser engraving operators at my father's small business company (Winterfell Gifts). This application takes in a webcam video stream and overlays helpful images to help the operator align items for proper laser engraving
